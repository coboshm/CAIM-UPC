<H1>CAIM lab, Session 3</H1>

<H1>Understanding the tf-idf vector model</H1>

<H2>0. Summary</H2>
<P>In this session: 
<UL>
  <LI>We will complete a program to display documents in the tf-idf vector model.</LI>
  <LI>We will compute document similarities with the cosine measure.</LI>
</UL>

<H2>1. Viewing documents in tf-idf format</H2>

<p>This part of the session is to make sure we understand the tf-idf weight scheme for representing
documents as vectors and the cosine similarity measure. 
We will complete a program that does basically the following:</p>

<pre><code>
   while (true) {
       1. read two filenames f1, f2;
       2. get the document identifiers id1, id2 of the files f1 and f2 in the index; 
       3. compute the tf-idf representation of id1, id2 as vectors v1, v2 (and print them);
       4. compute the cosine similarity of v1, v2 (and print it);
   }
</code></pre>

We will use an <i>IndexSearcher</i> object to search the index for the two files in step 2, 
and an <i>IndexReader</i> object to obtain the relevant information (tf's and idf's) 
from the index in step 3;
Steps 1 and 4 do not require accessing the index. 

<H2>2. Adding term frequencies to the index</H2>

<p>First of all, we need to make sure that the index we build contains all the information
required to compute tf-idf's, which is mainly frequencies of terms in documents.
At least in some versions of Lucene, the IndexFiles.java class does not really store them 
by default (to save space). With the program we are going to complete, if we use
such an index we will get a "null pointer error" because we will ask Lucene
to give us a certain TermFreqVector that is not there. 
</p>
<p>
To solve this, we need to change IndexFiles.java as follows. Locate the line where 
the "contents" field is added to the document that is being indexed. Will look roughly like this: 
</p>

<pre><code>
    doc.add(new Field("contents",something-about-a-FileReader-or-BufferedReader));
</code></pre>

<p>
and add the flag saying that the new Field should store TermVector information:
</p>

<pre><code>
    doc.add(new Field("contents",something-about-a-FileReader-or-BufferedReader,Field.TermVector.YES));
</code></pre>

<p>Compile IndexFiles.java, then index the novels directory.</p>

<H2>3. Computing tf-idf's and cosine measure</H2>

<p>Get the classes <i>TfIdfViewer.java</i> and <i>TermWeight.java</i>. 
TermWeight.java simply represents a pair (string,weight). 
Have a look at it and compile it now. 
TfIdfViewer.java is the (incomplete) program that implements 
the pseudocode above. When it is complete we should call it as:
</p>

<p>
<i>% java TfIdfViewer -index mydirectory
</i></p>

<p>
and then enter pairs of filenames to display
these files in tf-idf format and get their similarity. 
The names should include the directory paths as they appear in the
index (you can use lucene to view them). 
</p>

<p>Study the existing code:</p>

<ul>
<li> The main method parses the -index argument, creates IndexReader and IndexSearcher objects, 
     then implements the code above by calling appropriate functions</li> 
<li>The <i>findDocId</i> function creates a query to ask the index "give me the docid's of documents
     in the index having this string in the 'path' field"</li> 
<li> The <i>docFreq</i> function returns the number of documents in the index containing a given term 
     in the 'contents' field. Note that a lucene <i>Term</i> is a pair (fieldname,string)</li> 
<li>The (incomplete) <i>toTfIdf</i> function returns a vector of TermWeights 
     representing the document with the given docid. It:
       <ul>
         <li>First gets a TermFreqVector with (essentially) pairs (Term,frequency-of-the-Term-in-the-doc).</li>
         <li>Splits the TermFreqVector into two vectors, one of strings with the terms, the other with the corresponding
             frequencies. IMPORTANT: Lucene guarantees that the vector of strings is sorted according to String.compareTo, the 
             funny Java way for comparing strings. Recall that if x and y are strings, x.compareTo(y) returns a negative int 
             if x goes before y (in dictionary order), a positive int if x goes after y, and 0 if x == y. </li>
         <li>Gets the number of documents in the index.</li>
         <li>Then finally creates every TermWeight entry of the vector to be returned.</li>
       </ul> 
       Your task is to complete the computations of the tf-idf value to fill this vector. 
       You have all the ingredients ready, and only have to apply the formulas seen in class. 
       </li> 
<li>
Function <i>normalize</i> should compute the norm of the vector (square root of the sums of 
components squared) and divide the whole vector by it, so that the resulting vector has norm (length)
1. Complete this function. You may want to use function <i>Math.sqrt</i>. 
</li>
<li>
Function <i>printTermWeightVector</i> just prints one line for each entry in the given
vector of the form (term,weight). Complete this function. 
</li>
<li>
Function <i>cosineSimilarity</i> can be implemented by first normalizing both arguments, 
then computing their inner product. Complete this function. 
IMPORTANT: It must be an efficient implementation, with at most one scan 
of each vector. Use strongly that the vectors are sorted by term, according to
String.compareTo.
</li>
</ul>

<H2>4. Experimenting</H2>

<p>
Once you are done with your program, try it out with the test collections 
from the previous sessions. First, test your implementation by 
computing the similarity of a file with itself (what should it give?).
</p>

<p>You may even want to create a very simple collection with
two documents and three or four terms so that you can check by hand
your implementation.
</p>

<H2>5. Deliverables</H2>

<p>
<i>To deliver:</i>
Write a brief report (less than 1 page) explaining a) if you read and understood the 
code that was provided, b) if you succeeded in implementing everything, 
c) any major difficulties you found, and d) any observations 
on your experiments or on what you learned this way. 
Pdf format is preferred. 
Make sure it has your name, date, and title. 
You must also deliver all that classes that you modified.
Not the java classes you didn't modify. Please mark with visible comments 
the parts where you made changes. Pack everything in a .zip file. 
</p>

<p>
<i>Procedure:</i>
Normally, use the tool in the Rac&oacute; called "Practiques via web". 
In an emergency, send by email to "gavalda" followed by "@lsi.upc.edu".  
<p>

<p>
<i>Deadline:</i>
Work must be delivered within 2 weeks from the lab session you attend. 
Late deliveries risk being penalized or not accepted at all. 
If you anticipate problems with the deadline, tell me as soon as possible. 
</p>

<p><i>Rules:</i>
1. You can solve the problem alone or with one other person, 
but at most one lab assignment with the same person in the whole course. 
2. No plagiarism; don't discuss your work with others, except
your teammate if you are solving the problem in two;
if in doubt about what is allowed, ask us. 
3. If you feel you are spending much more time than the rest of the group, 
ask us for help. Questions can be asked either in person or by email, 
and you'll never be penalized by asking questions, 
no matter how stupid they look in retrospect.
